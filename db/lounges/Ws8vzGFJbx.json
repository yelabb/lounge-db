Cardholders can use their lounge visit entitlement to receive US$28 off the bill.

E.g. if a Cardholder registers 1 Guest they will receive US$56 off their bill which will be charged as 1 Cardholder visit + 1 Guest visit on their account. Only 1 Card per visit per Cardholder will be accepted and at point of registration. 2. The US$28 is valid for the purchase of any meal and/or drinks. To be eligible, Cardholders must present a valid Card and Boarding Pass with same-day travel before placing an order. 3. Cardholder may only register 1 Guest per visit to receive US$28 deduction. Any additional Guests will not be eligible for US$28 deduction. 4. USD$28 is non-transferable & cannot be exchanged for cash substitute or refund if the final bill is lower than US$28 per person. 5.
