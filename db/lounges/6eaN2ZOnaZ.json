Cardholders are advised to review full Conditions of access below before visiting. Please note that the restaurant may exceed their seating limit at certain times of the day & access to the restaurant is at their sole discretion. 1. Cardholders can use their lounge visit entitlement to receive £18 off the bill. 2. Each £18 deduction represents a single lounge visit within the Cardholder’s existing lounge visit allocation for which the Cardholder will, where applicable, be charged. For example, if a Cardholder signs in 1 Guest, they will receive £36 off their bill, which will be charged as 1 Cardholder visit + 1 Guest visit on their account. Cardholders who pay for their own visits and/or their guest visits are advised to check if the £18 credit provided per visit represents value prior to accessing the offer. Priority Pass and its Affiliated Companies shall not be liable should the offer value be less than Cardholder’s lounge visit fee. 3. The £18 is valid for the purchase of any meal and/or drinks in a single transaction. To be eligible, Cardholders must present a valid Card and Boarding Pass with confirmed same-day travel before placing an order. 4. The £18 is non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for a cash substitute or refund if the final bill is lower than £18 per person. 5.
