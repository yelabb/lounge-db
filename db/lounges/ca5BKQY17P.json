Cardholders can use their lounge visit entitlement to receive USD$28 off the bill. Each USD$28 deduction represents a single lounge visit within the Cardholder’s existing lounge visit allocation for which the Cardholder will, where applicable, be charged. E.g. if a Cardholder registers 1 Guest they will receive USD$56 off their bill which will be charged as 1 Cardholder visit + 1 Guest visit on their account. Only 1 Card per visit per Cardholder will be accepted and at point of registration. 2. The USD$28 is valid for the purchase of any meal and/or drinks. To be eligible, Cardholders must present a valid Card and Boarding Pass with confirmed same-day travel prior to placing an order. 3. USD$28 is non-transferable & cannot be exchanged for cash substitute or refund if the final bill is lower than USD$28 per person. 4.
